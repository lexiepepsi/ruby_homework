# Problem 1
# Create a class called Utility.
# Add a class method to Utility called count_words that takes a string as a parameter. The method should return a hash where the keys are words and the values are numbers indicating the number of times the key occurred in the input string. For example, Utility.count_words('the good and the bad and the ugly') should return:
# {"the" => 3, "good" => 1, "and" => 2, "bad" => 1, "ugly" => 1}
# Print the result of calling this method with the string it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
