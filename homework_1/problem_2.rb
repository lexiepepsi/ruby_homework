# Problem 2

# Write a method called add that takes two parameters, adds them together, and returns the result. For example, add(1, 2) should return 3.

# Then, add a line that calls your add method with two numbers of your choosing, stores the result in a variable with a name of your choosing, and then prints the result to the screen.

def add(a, b)
	a + b
end

result = add(1, 2)
puts(result)
